# Planning Library for Autonomous Vehicles

## Overview
The **Planning Library** provides advanced tools for trajectory planning and optimization in autonomous vehicles. It includes components for lane following, safety corridor planning, trust region optimization, and utilities to convert high-level routes into executable trajectories. Designed for efficiency, the library integrates optimization techniques and vehicle dynamics models.
